To populate the database tables the following steps were taken:

1. Get "Raw" data from World Bank or other source (only get data from the 9 required countries and in the 16 year time frame from 2005-2020)
2. Transpose raw data into blank excel file with column names as attributes for various dimensions and their respetive primary keys. 
3. Repeat process for all the data making sure that they follow the format of USA, CANADA, MEXICO, NIGER, SIERRA LEONE, CHAD, SRI LANKA, BANGLADESH, ETHIOPIA. 
(this will make the allocation of foreign keys in the fact table significantly easier)
4. Insert the data into the tables using "\copy <dimension-name> FROM <file-location> CSV HEADER;"
